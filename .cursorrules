# Cursor Rules for Eduardo Neto Portfolio

## Git Workflow Rules

Before suggesting any Git commands, review:
- `docs/branching-strategy.md` — Strategy and rationale
- `docs/git-workflow.md` — Step-by-step commands

### Mandatory Rules

1. Feature branches MUST be created from `dev`, never `main`
2. All PRs go to `dev` first, then `dev` → `main` for releases
3. Use "Rebase and Merge" exclusively — no merge commits
4. Rebasing `dev` onto `main` is maintainer-only (required for releases per docs/branching-strategy.md)
5. Always use `--force-with-lease` instead of `--force`
6. Branch names must follow: `feature/*`, `fix/*`, `chore/*`, or `refactor/*`
7. Use conventional commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`, `refactor:`, `docs:`, `test:`

### When User Asks About Git

- Reference the appropriate doc section
- Provide exact commands from `docs/git-workflow.md`
- Warn if the request violates the workflow

### Standard Git Command Patterns

```sh
# Creating a new feature branch (ALWAYS from dev)
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout -b feature/my-feature

# Rebasing before PR
git checkout dev
git pull
git checkout feature/my-feature
git rebase dev
git push --force-with-lease  # Only if already pushed

# Opening a PR
git push --set-upstream origin feature/my-feature
# Then open PR into `dev` (never directly to `main`)
```

## Code Quality Rules

- Before committing, always run ESLint to check for issues
- Before committing, always run tests and plan fixes if any fail
- Follow existing code patterns and conventions in the codebase
- Prefer editing existing files over creating new ones
- Keep changes focused and minimal

## Project Context

This is a portfolio website built with:
- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- TypeScript (strict mode)
- React 19
- Tailwind CSS 4
- Redux Toolkit / RTK Query
- Vitest for testing

The "Portfolio as Demo" philosophy means the codebase itself demonstrates senior engineering skills.
